# FlappyIOScriptTemplate
For learning purposes I was tinkering around with the javascript in flappybird.io and made a template script that handles the spacebar, and adds a preUpdate and postUpdate function to the game, allowing it to be easily modified. You don't have to download these to use them, just copy and paste the code into your chrome console(or equivalent for your browser) while flappybird.io is open. Keep in mind the template has no discernable effect on the game on it's own, however the rocket script does(use spacebar ingame.)

I'm not gonna document every function that exists in the game, but you can look through the code of the game with chrome. Just go to the game page, press f12 and click sources, then navigate to the .js file. You can make the code more easily readable with the button that looks like {}'s.
