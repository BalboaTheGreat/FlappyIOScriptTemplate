# FlappyIOScriptTemplate
For learning purposes I was tinkering around with the javascript in flappybird.io and made a template script that handles the spacebar, and adds a preUpdate and postUpdate function to the game, allowing it to be easily modified. You don't have to download these to use them, just copy and paste the code into your chrome console(or equivalent for your browser) while flappybird.io is open
